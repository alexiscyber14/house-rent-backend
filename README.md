<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ Greeting Rails <a name="about-project"></a>

The House Rental API is a web service that enables users to rent houses and manage reservations for those houses. It provides a secure and efficient platform for users to create accounts, log in, view available houses, make reservations, and manage their bookings. The API is designed to be easy to integrate with various front-end applications and offers robust authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure data security.

## API DOCUMENTATION

If you want to test with admin, you can use the info from the seeds.rb. The data from the seeds.rb file was already created on the server. If you want to test with localhost, you should run rails db:seed first before running the server.

- User Registration:
  To create a new user account, make a POST request to /sign_up. Include the user details (name, email, password, password_confirmation) in the request body as a JSON object.

- User Login:
  To authenticate and obtain a JWT token, make a POST request to /sign_in. Include the user credentials (email, password) in the request body as a JSON object. The API will respond with the JWT token that you can use for authenticated requests.

- User Logout:
  To log out, make a DELETE request to /sign_out.

- List All Houses:
  To retrieve a list of all houses, make a GET request to /api/v1/houses. The API will respond with a JSON array containing house details (name, rental_fee, location) for each available house.

- Show House Details:
  To view details of a specific house, make a GET request to /api/v1/houses/:id. Replace :id with the ID of the house you want to view. The API will respond with a JSON object containing detailed information about the house.

- Create a New House:
  To add a new house, make a POST request to /api/v1/houses?user_id=:user_id . Replace :user_id with the ID of the user which you want to use to create a house. And that creator needs to be an admin. Include the house details (name, rental_fee, location,date_built, category, description, image_url) in the request body as a JSON object. The API will respond with the newly created house details.

- Delete a House:
  To delete a specific house, make a DELETE request to /api/v1/houses/:id?user_id=:user_id. Replace :user_id with the ID of the user which you want to use to delete a house. And that user needs to be an admin. Replace :id with the ID of the house you want to delete. The API will delete the house and respond with a success message.

- List User Reservations:
  To view all reservations made by the logged-in user, make a GET request to /api/v1/reservations. The API will respond with a JSON array containing reservation details for the user's bookings.

- Show Reservation Details:
  To view details of a specific reservation, make a GET request to /api/v1/houses/:house_id/reservations/:id. Replace :house_id with the ID of the house associated with the reservation, and :id with the ID of the reservation you want to view. The API will respond with a JSON object containing detailed information about the reservation.

- Create a New Reservation:
  To make a reservation for a specific house, make a POST request to /api/v1/houses/:house_id/reservations. Include the reservation details (reservation_date, city) in the request body as a JSON object. The API will respond with the newly created reservation details.
